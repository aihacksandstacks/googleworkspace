**2. Add-on Functionality**

The Add-ons are designed to help users with Google Workspace activites.  For example, combine text from selected vertical cells in a Google Sheet into the top cell of the selection and subsequently delete the rows below the top cell.

**8. Changes to Terms**

We may modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you (e.g., via the Add-on listing or other communication). Your continued use of the Add-on after the effective date of the revised Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
